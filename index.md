> Considering its central importance, one might expect replication to be a prominent part of scientific practice. It is not.
> An important reason for this is that scientists have strong incentives to introduce new ideas but weak incentives to confirm the validity of old ideas.
> Innovative findings produce rewards
of publication, employment,
and tenure; replicated findings produce
a shrug.

> After developing SAV, we discovered a "sad fact" about archival repositories:
Many users do not *want* to deposit their digital objects in an archival repository,
or in any form of digital library for that matter! They are perfectly happy with
their objects residing on conventional file systems or web servers, where they
can use their favorite editors and tools to work on them. After all, it is not
*their* job to ensure that their objects are available to future generations years
from now. However, preservation *is* the job of a librarian, who needs tools to
"capture" important objects in a way that does not require active participation
by users (but of course requires user consent.)
