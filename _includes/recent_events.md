## Upcoming and Recent Events

### ISCA 2015 OCCAM Tutorial

Our tutorial will demonstrate that OCCAM is a complete infrastructure for end-to-end research from hypothesis through experimentation and finally visualization. After the tutorial, participants will be able to immediately make use of and collaborate within the system for their own purposes. Participants will also have the knowledge to set up their own instances of OCCAM, which is freely and publicly available, where they can help curate tools, simulators, and research workloads within our distributed and collaborative system.
