## Motivation

From their [about page](http://www.uni-weimar.de/en/media/chairs/webis/research/selected-projects/tira/):

> The possibility to reproduce and compare results of other researchers is essential for scientific progress. In many research fields, however, it is often impossible to specify the complete experiment setting; e.g., in the scope of a scientific publication. As a consequence, a  reliable comparison becomes difficult, if not impossible. TIRA is our approach to address this shortcoming. TIRA—jokingly, "The Incredible Research Assistant"—provides a means for evaluation as a service. It focuses on hosting shared tasks and facilitates the submission of softwares as opposed to the output of running a software on a test dataset (a so-called run). TIRA encapsulates the submitted softwares into virtual machines. This way, even after a shared task is over, the submitted softwares can be re-evaluated at the click of a button, which severely increased the reproducibility of the corresponding shared task.
