## Motivation

From their [home page]():

> Digital data is highly volatile, the processes and systems that make use of it even more so. Initially creating data and establishing workflows is very costly, in an ever-changing technological environment the upkeep presents a long-term challenge. To fulfill their designed purpose over a long period of time or for making research results, documents and decisions of today verifiable in the future, efficient and authentic access is required.
>
> In most cases the best way to render a certain digital object is using its creating applications, since these cover most of the object’s significant properties, hence providing an authentic and possibly an interactive user experience. Therefore, emulation is a key strategy to provide a digital object’s native environment and thus maintain its original **characteristics**, **look & feel** and **utility**.
