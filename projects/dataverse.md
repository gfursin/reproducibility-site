description: "The Dataverse is an open source web application to share, preserve, cite, explore and analyze research data. It facilitates making data available to others, and allows you to replicate others' work. Researchers, data authors, publishers, data distributors, and affiliated institutions all receive appropriate credit.


A Dataverse repository hosts multiple dataverses. Each dataverse contains datatset or other dataverses, and each dataset contains descriptive metadata and data files (including documentation and code that accompany the data)."

## Motivation

Taken from their [academic credit](http://dataverse.org/best-practices/academic-credit) page:

> By depositing data into Dataverse, which can be customized or embedded into a website with our Theme + Widgets feature, researchers make their datasets more discoverable to the scientific community. Widgets are available at the Dataverse and dataset level and can be embedded in any website to help others find a scholar's datasets more easily.
>
> By increasing research data's visibility with Dataverse, researchers can get recognition and proper academic credit for their scholarly work through a Data Citation. These citations also help ensure that research data meet funder and publisher requirements; reused by other scholars; replicated for verification; and tracked to measure usage and impact over time, which can help fund future research.
