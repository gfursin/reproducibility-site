## Motivation

From their [Product Overview](http://www.windriver.com/products/product-overviews/wr-lab-cloud_overview.pdf):

>Developing and testing software for devices and systems in multiple configurations is a
challenge. The systems can be physically large and can contain multiple nodes, both qualities
that are tough to manage in a physical lab. And as more devices and systems become
connected in the Internet of Things (IoT), businesses are looking to software to provide the
added value in their solutions. In order to keep this software up to date, organizations are
adopting more agile and continuous deployment strategies, which can compound the challenges
of working with physical hardware.
>
> These challenges can be overcome by using virtual platforms and simulations of networks
and the environment. This approach converts hardware into software simulations that can
be created, configured, and managed with ease.
>
> Wind River® Helix™ Lab Cloud is a virtual lab for your virtual hardware. It simulates hardware
in a cloud platform, providing almost unlimited access to development assets and cloudbased
collaboration across enterprises, and enabling high levels of automation of testing
and integration tasks for today’s electronic systems. Using Lab Cloud, you can rapidly create
and deliver IoT device and system software, both within your organization and with outside
partners. From a single device to a system-of-systems with hundreds of components, it’s
easy to run and share in Lab Cloud.
