## Motivation

From their [about page](https://olivearchive.org/about/):

> Today, an increasing fraction of the world’s intellectual output is in the form of executable content. These include simulation models, tutoring systems, expert systems, data visualization tools, and so on. Even content that could be static (such as a company’s product information Web page) is often dynamically generated through execution of code that customizes the content and appearance at runtime... [Olive seeks] to freeze and precisely reproduce the execution state that produced this dynamic content.
> -- M. Satyanarayanan

Also included there:

> Goals
>
> * Enable libraries to achieve their mission of preserving the scholarly record
> * Provide a platform for preserving, searching, extending, and distributing executable content
> * Establish a workflow for this preservation
> * Determine the obstacles to preservation and distribution
> * Retain executable content in its original state such that end users may interact with it freely
